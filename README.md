# Description

The goal of this application is to give users a platform that will take them through a set of instructions and deliver a relaxation activity that will curb their stress eating.

Users will listen to a relaxation activity and then follow instructions to eat a specific fruit. The individual will repeat this process 7 times during the week. After this period of time, the user will no longer need to listen to the relaxation activity. By only eating the fruit, the user will feel relaxed and will no longer feel the need to overeat when they feel stressed.
